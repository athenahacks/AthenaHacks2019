            <div class="question">What is a hackathon?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              A hackathon is a weekend-long gathering of curious minds to learn something new. Often times, attendees do this by picking up a project of their choosing to work on for the weekend. This is a great way to really dive into a topic you've been meaning to explore and you'll get to make new friends as you work in a team! Hackathons provide other ways to learn, too - you can attend workshops, listen to speakers, or network and meet with other students and representatives from companies!

          <div class="col-4">
            <div class="question">Can I attend?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              If you are an undergraduate or high school female* who loves to hack, the answer is YES! Women* in industry are welcome to mentor! If you identify as male, we're sorry to say this hacking environment is not for you. This hackathon is about bringing women together in a comfortable setting. However, if you are a male interested in helping our cause, we'd love to have you as a mentor or volunteer! Mentor applications are currently closed for this year but if you still want to get involved, reach out to us at athenahacks@gmail.com.

            <div class="answer">
              No! This is the perfect place for any student to create their first coding project or for more experienced individuals to learn even more and build a great project! We'll have plenty of resources for beginners to get started!

              If you're a high schooler who will be at least 17 years old by AthenaHacks, you are invited to AthenaHacks! You will need to have your parent/guardian pick you up for the evening and then return you back on Sunday morning, however.
